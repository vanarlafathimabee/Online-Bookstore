<h2 style="font-family:Dyuthi;color:DarkBlue;">Description :</h2>
<p>Lyra is an orphan and leads a carefree life until she overhears a conversation about ‘Dust’. Intrigued by ‘Dust’ she wishes to know more about it. Her wish is about to come true when children (including Lyra’s playmate Roger) start disappearing and the exotic Mrs. Coulter arrives at Oxford to take Lyra away and to prune her into a fine lady. Together with her own daemon Pantalaimon, Lyra begins her journey to the Arctic, armed with an ‘alethiometer’ or a ‘truth-teller’ to find her friend Roger, kidnapped by the ‘Gobblers’ and to free Lord Asriel who has been imprisoned for conducting experiments on Dust who he believes holds the key to travel to parallel universes. On the way she meets the Gyptians, witches of the clan of Serafina Pekkala and an armoured polar bear, Iorek, who unite to help her towards the destiny she was prophesied to fulfill.</p>
