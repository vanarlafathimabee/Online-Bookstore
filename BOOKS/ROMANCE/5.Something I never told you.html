<p>"She was gone, again; and I failed again and could not tell her how much I loved her."
Ronnieâ€™s fate gives him a second chance with Adira. His one-sided love story moves at a faster pace this time but instead of becoming his lover; she chooses to become his friend instead.
He needs a mentor and Rajbir steps in just in time.
Something I never told you is a transforming tale of love, determination, belief and finding one's strengths.
