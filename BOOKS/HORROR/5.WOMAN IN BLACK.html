<h2 style="font-family:Dyuthi;color:DarkBlue;">Description :</h2>
<p>On a crisp Christmas eve, the elderly Arthur Kipps rests contentedly in front of a roaring fire, surrounded by his stepchildren and loving wife Esme. All is at peace with Arthur’s world; all is as it should be. But when the young men start to tell ghost stories, Arthur’s idyllic night is ruined. It is only now, after so many years, that Arthur puts his pen to paper and tells the story that haunts him – the story that keeps him up at night shaking with terror, the reason for his distress this Christmas night.
